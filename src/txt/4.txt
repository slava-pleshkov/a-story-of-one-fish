Some governments make it easy to fish illegally.

Some states provide flags of registration to nefarious vessel owners and conceal the whereabouts of these vessels and their activities. Tightening policies though regional fisheries management organizations, international treaties, and stronger control of seafood imports at the national level can help increase accountability for such countries. For example, the European Union, with its red yellow green card system, has forced numerous countries to ensure that the seafood they import to the EU as caught legally.
